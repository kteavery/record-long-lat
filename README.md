# record-long-lat
Electron app to create ground truth for locating objects on radar

## Startup 
1) Unzip record-long-lat.zip and launch the app. 
2) Select the data directory using the "choose directory" button. The data directory will have the subfolders Roost_Reflectivity, Roost Velocity, Roost_Rho_HV, and Roost_Zdr, each containing images.

## Controls
**Click** to label a roost. (You can click multiple times to label multiple roosts in one image, but most images will contain only one roost.) 

Use the **next** and **previous** buttons to navigate forwards and backwards. The **tab** key will also take you to the next set of images. 

The **clear** button clears all labels for a given set of images. 

The **flag** button flags a set of images for further review. Flag a set of images if you are very unsure where the roost is.
